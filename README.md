# VHDL_LCD_Keypad

#### About
This project serves as a way for me to learn VHDL and FPGA firmware design using an FPGA, and VHDL to implement a basic matrix hex keypad decoder and LCD driver in VHDL.

It uses an [Intel Max 10](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/programmable/fpga/max-10.html) FPGA (10M080SAE144C8G) as the logic device to take input from a [hex matrix keypad](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/14881) control a simple [16x2 Liquid Crystal Display](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9052) (LCD).
